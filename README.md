> AI-powered learning coach that accelerates mastery through spaced repetition, personalized syllabi, and active practice.

**Built for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** - Integrates AI coaching directly into your development environment.
Also supports [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) with agent-specific `AGENTS.md` instructions and shared learning tools. Codex support is less strict than Claude Code because Codex does not currently expose a CLI flag for replacing the system prompt; Learn FASTER can only inject coaching behavior through `AGENTS.md`, startup prompts, or future skill-style instructions. Codex also only exposes its structured user-input tool in Plan mode, so in Default mode it cannot present guided choice prompts the same way Claude Code can.
[Oh My Pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) is supported natively: project-native `.omp/commands/`, `.omp/agents/` and `.omp/rules/` files, the learning mode injected through `omp --system-prompt`, and resume and fork mapped onto the Oh My Pi command line. Its first run has no plan phase, because `omp --plan` selects a planning model rather than entering plan mode.

## Why Learn FASTER?

Master any technical skill with science-backed learning principles:

-   **Personalized syllabi** generated for your skill level and learning goals
-   **Spaced repetition** system that schedules reviews at optimal intervals
-   **Four learning modes** - choose Balanced, Exam-Prep, Theory-Focused, or Practical
-   **Active practice** with auto-generated exercises and projects
-   **Progress tracking** to visualize your learning journey

## The FASTER Framework

-   **F**orget: Beginner's mindset - approach topics with fresh perspective
-   **A**ct: Learn by doing - hands-on practice over passive reading
-   **S**tate: Optimize focus - create ideal learning conditions
-   **T**each: Explain to retain - teaching reinforces understanding
-   **E**nter: Consistent sessions - regular practice builds momentum
-   **R**eview: Spaced repetition - review at intervals for long-term retention

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Option 1: Persistent Installation (Recommended)

Install once and use across all projects:

```bash
uv tool install learn-faster --from git+https://github.com/cheukyin175/learn-faster-kit.git
```

Then in any project directory, simply run:

```bash
learn-faster
```

This auto-initializes the project, asks which supported agent to use, and launches it with FASTER coaching enabled.

### Option 2: One-Time Use

Run directly without installation:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/cheukyin175/learn-faster-kit.git learn-faster
```

### What Gets Installed

On first run, learn-faster creates shared learning tools plus agent-specific instructions.

For Claude Code:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/practice-creator.md
│   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── learn.md
│   │   ├── review.md
│   │   └── progress.md
│   └── settings.local.json
├── .learning/
│   ├── config.json (tracks initialization)
│   ├── scripts/
│   │   ├── init_learning.py
│   │   ├── log_progress.py
│   │   ├── review_scheduler.py
│   │   └── generate_syllabus.py
│   └── references/faster_framework.md
└── CLAUDE.md
```

For Codex, run `learn-faster init --agent codex`. It creates the same `.learning/` shared tools and writes Codex instructions to `AGENTS.md`. Because Codex does not provide a system-prompt replacement flag, adherence depends on Codex reading those project instructions and the launch prompt. Codex guided-choice interactions are also limited: the user-input tool is available only in Plan mode, so Default mode falls back to plain conversational questions.

For Oh My Pi, run `learn-faster init --agent omp`. It creates the same `.learning/` shared tools plus:

```
your-project/
└── .omp/
    ├── agents/          (mode-specific subagents)
    ├── commands/        (mode-specific workflows, always including learn.md)
    └── rules/learn-faster.md
```

The rule file carries `alwaysApply: true`, so the coaching protocols stay in context for the whole session.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the tool**

    ```bash
    uv tool install learn-faster --from git+https://github.com/cheukyin175/learn-faster-kit.git
    ```

2. **Launch in any project directory**

    ```bash
    cd your-learning-project
    learn-faster
    ```

    First run will:

    - Prompt you to select a learning mode
    - Initialize the project structure
    - Launch your configured agent with FASTER coaching enabled

3. **Start learning**

    ```bash
    /learn "Golang fundamentals"
    ```

    The AI coach will generate a personalized syllabus and guide your learning session.

## Demo: Teach-Back in Action

The "T" in FASTER—teaching to retain—is the key differentiator. Here's how it works:

```bash
mkdir learn-go && cd learn-go
learn-faster                    # Select "Balanced" mode
/learn "Go error handling"      # In Claude Code
```

```
Coach: You've just learned about error wrapping. Ready to teach it back?
       ┌ Teach Back
       │ ● Yes, let me explain
       │ ○ Need review first
       │ ○ Not sure yet
       └

You:   So when you wrap an error with fmt.Errorf and %w, you're adding
       context like "failed to open config" while keeping the original
       error inside. Then errors.Is can still match the root cause.

Coach: ✅ Great explanation! You nailed the key insight—wrapped errors
       preserve the chain for inspection. Adding "error wrapping" to
       your review schedule. First review tomorrow.
```

**Why this works:** Explaining concepts in your own words forces active recall—proven to boost retention 2-3x vs passive reading. The coach won't just tell you answers; it guides you to construct understanding yourself.

## Usage

### CLI Commands

-   `learn-faster` - Launch the configured agent with FASTER coaching (auto-initializes on first run)
-   `learn-faster init` - Force re-initialization or switch learning modes
-   `learn-faster init --agent omp` - Initialize the project for Oh My Pi
-   `learn-faster init --agent codex` - Initialize the project for Codex
-   `learn-faster resume [<id>] [--pick] [--fork]` - Resume a previous coaching session (`--pick` to choose interactively; `--fork` to branch into a new session id, which Oh My Pi allows only with an explicit id)
-   `learn-faster version` - Show current version

### Learning Commands

Once Claude Code or Oh My Pi is running, use these commands:

-   `/learn [topic]` - Start or continue learning a topic with personalized syllabus
-   `/review` - Spaced repetition review session for topics you've learned
-   `/progress` - View detailed progress report and learning statistics

## Learning Modes

Choose the mode that fits your learning style:

-   **Balanced** - Mix of theory, practice, and real-world application (recommended for most learners)
-   **Exam-Prep** - Focused on recall, practice tests, and certification preparation
-   **Theory-Focused** - Deep conceptual understanding with mental models and first principles
-   **Practical** - Project-based learning with immediate application

Each mode provides a tailored coaching experience with mode-specific syllabi and exercises.
